## Manual
You are about to play a very simple RPG. Every adventure is unique as a lot of variables are set randomly.
Everytime you move forward you will either find a shop where you can buy and sell stuff or just manage your inventory and you will fight dangerous enemies each with their unique stats.
You as well as the monsters have different stats:
- HP: The health you have (you can heal it or take damage, at zero it's death) 
- STR: The strenght of your attack (This is the basic damage you deal)
- INT: The intelligence wich gives you magic power (Not yet implemented)
- LCK: Your luck to make critical hits
- DXT: The dexterity you dodge your opponent attacks

When you arrive at the 20th position, you'll fight Hastzora. This is the final and most dangerous Boss of the game. Prepare yourself well for this encounter, defeat enemies to loot golds and gears to equip and use the shops to upgrade your champions.
